TODO for filtergen

Easy:
 * Better documentation.
 * Support scripts, documentation and Makefiles for various
   systems.
 * Logging options.
 * ICMP support.
 * Better Makefiles.

Harder:
 * Testing and auditing of generated rulesets.
 * Optimiser (de-pessimiser :-) for intermediate step, and
   also generated rulesets (the latter could be done with a
   peephole optimiser, I think).
 * Option to have just a single "state OK -> accept" rule,
   instead of one per bit of allowed traffic.
 * Support for sub-groups where supported by the underlying
   filter.  For example:

   input eth0 source wwwserv dest dbserv
   [
   	proto tcp dport { 1521 appserv1 appserv2 appserv3 } accept;
	proto udp dport { ... } accept;
	reject;
   ];

   would have the rules inside "[]" put into a separate chain
   (or "group" for ipfilter) so that the average packet has to
   be tested against fewer rules.

Hard:
 * Implement a negation unroller for filters which can't, for
   example, negate a match.  (For example, Ciscos can't say
   "match all but this host".)

   This is possible, but tiresome, and will require an optimiser
   if the generated rulesets are not to Suck.
