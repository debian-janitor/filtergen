# test case for forwarded packets that shouldn't get dropped
# expected output is to not put the DROP at the end of the FORWARD chain,
# but instead at the end of the FORW_OUT chain, otherwise packets for the
# second block will get dropped before they're accepted.

# similar test needed for REJECT

{ input eth0 forward; output eth0 forward }

	# Iptables backend bug will DROP all packets forwarded via eth0

	source { 10.0.0.2/24 } accept;
