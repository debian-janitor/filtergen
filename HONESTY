	FULL-DISCLOSURE (or HONESTY)

WHAT'S THIS?

Here, I explain the status of the package in non-salesman mode.
It might help you to decide whether this package is currently
useful to you (though shouldn't put you off contributing).


STATUS

Hard to tell.  The iptables and ipchains drivers support all the
features of the parser and seem to generate sane-looking rules.
I believe that the ipchains driver doesn't leak, though I have a
couple of issues with the iptables one.

The ipfilter backend seems to generate OK-looking rules, but it
doesn't support NAT and I don't even have a BSD box to test it on.

The language is likely to evolve as more features are implemented.
Specifically, I'd like it to express fundamental networking and,
specifically, filtering concepts, rather than being an iptables
macro language.

The Cisco ACL generator will silently drop negations, which makes
is essentially useless for a lot of things.  This will be fixed,
but probably not soon.

The transparent proxying, masquerading and logging support is not
as flexible as I'd like it to be.

I have recently converted my home gateway to use it and it is
working well.  But "working well" does not imply security, and I
have not expended a great deal of effort in auditing.
