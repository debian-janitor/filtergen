filtergen (0.10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patched filtergen to add a command to generate flush rules, thus cleaning
    the initscript a little.

filtergen (0.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a `check' argument to /etc/init.d/filtergen.
  * Removed `ipfilter' from the backends that get piped into a shell.
    Instead it should get piped into ipfilter somehow.  I will worry about
    that when ipfilter gets packaged.
