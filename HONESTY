	FULL-DISCLOSURE (or HONESTY)

WHAT'S THIS?

Here, I explain the status of the package in non-salesman mode.
It might help you to decide whether this package is currently
useful to you (though shouldn't put you off contributing).


STATUS

Hard to tell.  I believe that the iptables and ipchains drivers
support all the features of the parser and seem to generate sane-
looking rules.  The ipfilter backend seems to generate OK-looking
rules, but I don't even have a BSD box to test it on.

The Cisco ACL generator will silently drop negations, which makes
is essentially useless for a lot of things.  This will be fixed,
but probably not soon.

The transparent proxying, masquerading and logging support is not
as flexible as I'd like it to be.

I have recently converted my home gateway to use it and it is
working well.  But "working well" does not imply security, and I
have not expended a great deal of effort in auditing.
