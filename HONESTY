	FULL-DISCLOSURE (or HONESTY)

WHAT'S THIS?

Here, I explain the status of the package in non-salesman mode.
It might help you to decide whether this package is currently
useful to you (though shouldn't put you off contributing).


STATUS

Hard to tell.  The iptables and ipchains drivers support all the
features of the parser and seem to generate sane-looking rules.
I believe that the ipchains driver doesn't leak, though I have a
couple of issues with the iptables one.

The ipfilter backend seems to generate OK-looking rules, but it
doesn't support NAT and I don't even have a BSD box to test it on.

The Cisco IOS driver is incomplete and can ignore negations.  I'd
love for someone who can test it to take it over.

The language is likely to evolve as more features are implemented.
Specifically, I'd like it to express fundamental networking and
filtering concepts, rather than being an iptables macro language.

The transparent proxying, masquerading and logging support is not
as flexible as I'd like it to be.

"Grouping" (sub-chain) support is a recent addition, and I can't
be 100% sure it's working properly, as it was written to support
configs more complication that I need.

And the documentation could use some attention.

I have been using it on my personal gateway for around six months
now, and have two production webservers using it too.  It has all
worked very well.  But "working well" does not imply security, and
I have not expended a great deal of effort in auditing.
