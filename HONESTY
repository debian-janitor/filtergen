	FULL-DISCLOSURE (or HONESTY)

WHAT'S THIS?

Here, I explain the status of the package in non-salesman mode.
It might help you to decide whether this package is useful to
you (though shouldn't put you off contributing).


STATUS

Hard to tell.  I believe that the iptables and ipchains drivers
support all the features of the parser and seem to generate sane-
looking rules.  The ipfilter backend seems to generate OK-looking
rules, but I don't even have a BSD box to test it on.

The Cisco ACL generator will silently drop negations, which makes
is essentially useless for a lot of things.  This will be fixed,
but probably not soon.

The parser lacks some fairly important features like transparent
proxying support, masquerading, and various others.  It can't be
instructed to log or not log permitted, denied, etc., packets.

I am not personally using it to generate rules for my servers and
firewalls, though I intend to change that once I've added logging
and transparent proxying support.
