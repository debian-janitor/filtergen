INSTALLING filtergen
====================

Installing filtergen is easy.  If you don't find it easy, that's a bug.  Send
bug reports to jaq@spacepants.org.

If you're on a Red Hat-like RPM-based system, you should be able just to run
"rpm -ta" on the tarball.

filtergen's build system uses SCons, rather than the GNU autotools or a custom
Makefile.  To build and install, ensure you have SCons, gcc, and flex
installed, and type "scons install".
