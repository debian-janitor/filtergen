.SH DESCRIPTION
.B filtergen
generates packet filtering rules from a high-level description language.
The same ruleset can be converted into a number of output rule types,
depending upon which backend is chosen.

.SH USAGE
.B filtergen
reads the ruleset from the file specified on the command-line (or standard
input if \fBinput-file\fR is "\-" or not specified) and outputs to standard
output or \fBoutput-file\fR via an optionally specified backend.

.PP
These options are accepted:
.TP
.BI "\-n"
Omit "skeleton" rules.  Some backends (notably the
.I iptables
and
.I ipchains
ones) generate extra rules at the beginning or end of the output, which
might flush any existing rules, set default handling, etc.  This option
suppresses any such rules, which can be useful for debugging, or to
better integrate with other scripts or rule generators.

.TP
.BI "\-l"
Lightweight state matching.  The backend can use this option to generate
shorter rulesets by reducing the number of rules required for matching
packets on established connections.  This can be more efficient to
execute, but may be less tight, depending upon the quality of the state
engine in the underlying packet filter.

.TP
.BI "\-m"
Perform lookups.  This causes all hostnames and service names to be
turned into IP addresses and port numbers, respectively.

.TP
.BI "\-h"
Operate in "host" mode.  The backend will default to omitting rules
which allow packets to be routed, as though every rule had the "local"
option set.  This can be overridden per-rule with the "forward" option.
(See \fBfilter_syntax\fR(8) for more details.)

.TP
.BI "\-r"
Operate in "router" mode.  This is the opposite of "host" mode: the
backend will default to omitting rules which deal with packets destined
locally, as though every rule had the "forward" option set.  This can be
overridden per-rule with the "local" option.  (See \fBfilter_syntax\fR(8)
for more details.)

.TP
.BI "\-o output-file"
Write output to \fIoutput-file\fR instead of standard output.

.TP
.BI "\-t driver"
If specified, \fIdriver\fR will be used to select an output ruleset type,
otherwise the default of \fIiptables\fR will be used.  Supported backends
are \fIiptables\fR, \fIipchains\fR, \fIipfilter\fR and \fIcisco\fR (for
Cisco IOS access-lists).

.TP
.BI "\-F"
Flush mode.  Generate a set of rules for clearing all rules from the packet
filter.  Useful for firewall scripts that need to `shutdown' the firewall.
You can supply a \fIpolicy\fR argument in place of the usual filename, to
specify whether the flushed filter should default to \fBaccept\fR,
\fBreject\fB, or \fBdrop\fR.  It defaults to \fBaccept\fR, equivalent to
having no filter loaded at all.

.SH BUGS
Not all backends implement all features.
